","Malaria is a significant global health issue, and discovering new compounds with novel mechanisms of action can be a game-changer. I'd be happy to help you with some potential starting points.

**Sexual Stage Inhibitors:**

1. **SPF1660**: A small molecule inhibitor of the Plasmodium falciparum sexual stage, which targets the Plasmodium-specific protein, Pfs25. SPF1660 has shown promising results in preclinical studies.
2. **PfATP4**: An inhibitor of the Plasmodium falciparum ATP4 kinase, which is essential for the parasite's sexual stage. PfATP4 has been shown to be effective in reducing parasite transmission.
3. **PfCRT**: A compound that targets the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT), which is involved in the parasite's sexual stage. PfCRT has shown potential in reducing parasite viability.

**Asexual Stage Inhibitors:**

1. **Dihydroartemisinin (DHA)**: A derivative of artemisinin, which targets the Plasmodium falciparum asexual stage. DHA has been shown to be effective in reducing parasite load and has a novel mechanism of action.
2. **KAE609 (NITD609)**: A small molecule inhibitor of the Plasmodium falciparum asexual stage, which targets the Plasmodium-specific protein, PfATP4. KAE609 has shown promising results in preclinical studies.

","Exciting work on antimalarial compound screening!

To address your questions:

1. **Cross-stage activity prediction**: While there's no straightforward way to predict liver-stage activity from in vitro asexual activity, you can use various computational tools and machine learning models to identify potential candidates. Some approaches include:
	* Using in silico models, such as the Plasmodium falciparum Liver Stage (PFLS) model, which predicts the likelihood of a compound being active against the liver stage.
	* Applying machine learning algorithms, like random forest or support vector machines, to identify patterns in the in vitro asexual activity data that correlate with liver-stage activity.
	* Utilizing databases, such as the Malaria Box or the PlasmoDB, which contain information on compounds with known activity against both asexual and liver stages.
2. **Mechanism of action prediction**: Predicting the mechanism of action (MoA) of a compound is a complex task, as it often requires experimental validation. However, you can use various computational tools and databases to identify potential MoAs based on the compound's structure and activity profile. Some options include:
	* Using MoA prediction tools, such as the Molecular Library of Antimalarial Agents (MLAMA) or the Antimalarial Compound Database (ACD), which provide information on potential MoAs based on compound structure and activity.
	* Analyzing the compound's structure using tools like the BindingDB or the PDB, which can help identify potential binding sites and interactions with protein targets.
	* Consulting databases, such as the Malaria Box or the PlasmoDB, which contain information on compounds with known MoAs.

Some popular tools and databases for antimalarial compound analysis and MoA prediction include:

* Malaria Box: A collection of 400 compounds with known activity against P. falciparum, including both asexual and liver stages.
* PlasmoDB: A database containing information on P. falciparum proteins, including those involved in the liver stage.
* MLAMA: A database of antimalarial compounds with predicted MoAs.
