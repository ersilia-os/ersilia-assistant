I am working on a drug discovery project for malaria. I am interested in compounds active in the sexual and asexual stages of the parasite. I want some good starting points with new mechanisms of action.

I have a dataset of 300 compounds screened in a whole cell Tuberculosis assay.  I want derivatives with better activity and PK profile.

I have an in-house library of 200 compounds to screen for an early stage drug discovery Leishmaniasis project. I want compounds that are active against the intracellular stage of the parasite (L. donovani). If possible, with low toxicity in human macrophages. I want to prioritize 20 compounds for experimental screening.

The HIV virus remains dormant in human cells and cannot be targeted with current treatments. I am investigating latency reversal agents and we have screened 500 compounds. None of them achieves our threshold of activity and I aim to find analogs with better latency reversal properties without increasing human cell toxicity.

Schistosoma is a difficult disease to cure with several stages of development of the parasite. I want compounds that target both the larval and adult stages, and if possible candidates inhibiting energy metabolism pathways. I have a database of natural product compounds with its associated activity in an in vitro assay for S.mansoni larvae.

I have screened a library of compounds for drug-resistant E.coli in in vitro assays (% inhibition and MIC). I want analogs of active molecules with improved ADME properties including bioavailability. I do not want compounds that will be effluxed from the cells using the known pathways.

I have designed a library of compounds assembled from natural product databases reported to have antibacterial properties. I am looking for a broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound that is able to kill multiple MDR strains in Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus among others.

I have screened 200 compounds in vitro against P.falciparum (asexual). I want to know if any of them would also be active in the liver stage. Can I predict their mechanism of action?

My research focuses on Neisseria gonorrhoeae. I have a chemical series of interest and I want to screen the best 50 compounds.

I work on malaria drug discovery. We need compounds with a longer half-life so that they do not need to be given daily. They should be available orally. Can you propose analogues of my dataset? They should be active in animal models not only in vitro.

I am interested in Gram-negative bacteria. I want compounds able to cross the bacterial membrane and have an effect across several MDR pathogens. I work with african natural products.
