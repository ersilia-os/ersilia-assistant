    "Title": "Morgan Fingerprints",
    "Description": "The Morgan Fingerprints are one of the most widely used molecular representations. They are circular representations (from an atom,search the atoms around with a radius n) and can have thousands of features. This implementation uses the RDKit package and is done with radius 3 and 2048 dimensions,providing a binary vector as output. For Morgan counts, see eos5axz.",
