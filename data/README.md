# Generation of queries
The `generate_queries.py` script keeps adding queries to the `data/ai_generated_queries.csv` file. That file has two columns:
- `model_ids`: These are the Ersilia Model Hub identifiers that were initially used to generate the queries. If necessary, they can be used as validation for the assistant (synthetic data).
- `query`: This is the actual query generated by the LLM.
You can run the `generate_queries.py` as many times as you want, and queries will be **appended** to the output file.
It is necessary that, in the current folder, a `.env` file is present with an `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
