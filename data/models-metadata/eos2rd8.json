    "Description": "MolT5 (Molecular T5) is a self-supervised learning framework pretrained on unlabeled natural language text and molecule strings with two end goals: molecular captioning (given a molecule, generate its description) and text-based de novo molecular generation (given a description, propose a molecule that matches it). This implementation is focused on molecular captioning.\n",
