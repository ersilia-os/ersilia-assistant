    "Title": "Passive permeability based on simulations",
    "Description": "Using Coarse Grained (CG) models, where several atoms are aggregated into a single bead, the authors obtain a set of 500,000 compounds with their simulated permeability across a single-component DOPC lipid bilayer. With this approach, the authors are able to cover a large and representative portion of the chemical space. We have used the data generated in this publication to train a simple regression model to predict compound permeability.\n",
