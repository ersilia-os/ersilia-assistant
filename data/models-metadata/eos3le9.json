    "Title": "HepG2 Toxicity - MMV",
    "Description": "This model predicts the toxicity of small molecules in HepG2 cells. It has been developed by Ersilia thanks to data provided by MMV. We have used two cut-offs to define activity (5 and 10 uM respectively) with a dataset of 1335 molecules. 5-fold crossvalidation showed an AUROC of 0.8 and 0.77 respectively",
