    "Description": "This model predicts the antimalarial potential of small molecules in vitro. We have collected the data available from the Open Source Malaria Series 4 molecules and used two cut-offs to define activity, 1 uM and 2.5 uM. The training has been done with the LazyQSAR package (Morgan Binary Classifier) and shows an AUROC >0.8 in a 5-fold cross-validation on 20% of the data held out as test. These models have been used to generate new series 4 candidates by Ersilia.",
