    "Description": "The authors curated a dataset of 282 compounds from ChEMBL, of which 160 (56.7%) were labeled as active N. gonorrhoeae inhibitor compounds. They used this dataset to build a na\u00efve Bayesian model and used it to screen a commercial library. With this method,they identified and validated two hits. We have used the dataset to build a model using LazyQSAR with Ersilia Compound Embeddings as molecular descriptors. LazyQSAR is an AutoML Ersilia-developed library.",
