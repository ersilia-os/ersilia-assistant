    "Title": "Atomization energy of small molecules",
    "Description": "The model predicts the atomization energy of a molecule. It has been trained using the QM7 dataset from MoleculeNet, a subset of GDB13 containing all molecules up to 23 atoms (7 heavy atoms + C, S, O, N). This dataset contains the computed atomization energy of 7165 molecules. This model has been trained using the GROVER transformer (see eos7w6n or grover-embedding for a detail of the molecular featurization step with GROVER)\n",
