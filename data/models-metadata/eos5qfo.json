    "Description": "Utilizes a Weisfeiler-Lehman network (attentive mechanism) to predict the products of an organic reaction given the reactants. The model identifies the reaction centers (set of atoms/bonds that change from reactant to product) and obtains the products directly from a graph-based neural network.\n",
