    "Title": "Natural product likeness score",
    "Description": "The model is a derivation of the natural product fingerprint (eos6tg8). In addition to generating specific natural product fingerprints, the activation value of the neuron that predicts if a molecule is a natural product or not can be used as a NP-likeness score. The method outperforms the NP\\_Score implemented in RDKit.\n",
