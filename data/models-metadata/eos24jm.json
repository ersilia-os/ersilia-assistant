    "Title": "QcrB Inhibition (M. tuberculosis)",
    "Description": "The cytochrome bcc complex (QcrB) is a subunit of the mycobacterial cyt-bcc-aa3 oxidoreductase in the electron transport chain (ETC), and it has been suggested as a good M.tb target due to the bacteria's dependence on oxidative phosphorylation for its growth. The authors use a dataset of 352 molecules, of which 277 are classified as active (QIM < 1 uM), 58 as moderately active ( 1 > QIM < 20 uM) and 78 as inactive (QIM > 20). Qim refers to quantification of intracellular mycobacteria.",
