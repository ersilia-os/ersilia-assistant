    "Title": "Predict bioactivity against Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2",
    "Description": "MProPred predicts the efficacy of compounds against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, which is a promising drug target since it processes polyproteins of SARS-CoV-2. This model uses PaDEL-Descriptor to calculate molecular descriptors of compounds. It is based on a dataset of 758 compounds that have inhibition efficacy against the Main Protease, as published in peer-reviewed journals between January, 2020 and August, 2021. Input compounds are compared to compounds in the dataset to measure molecular similarity with MACCS.",
