    "Title": "DrugTax: Drug taxonomy",
    "Description": "DrugTax takes SMILES inputs and classifies the molecule according to their taxonomy, organic or inorganic kingdom and their subclasses, using a 0/1 binary classification for each one. It generates a vector of 163 features including the taxonomy classification and other key information such as number of carbons, nitrogens\u2026 These vectors can be used for subsequent molecular representation in chemoinformatic pipelines.\n",
