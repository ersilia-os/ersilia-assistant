    "Title": "Inhibition of A.Baumannii growth",
    "Description": "This model is a Chemprop neural network trained with a growth inhibition dataset. Authors screened ~7,500 molecules for those that inhibited the growth of A. baumannii in vitro. They discovered abaucin, an antibacterial compound with narrow-spectrum activity against A. baumannii.",
