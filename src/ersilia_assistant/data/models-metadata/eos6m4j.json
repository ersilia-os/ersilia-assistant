    "Description": "Molecular representation of small molecules via descriptor-based molecular maps (images). The fingerprint-based molecular maps are available at eos59rr. These images can be used as inputs for an image-based deep learning model such as a convolutional neural network. The authors have demonstrated high performance of MolMap out-of-the-box with a broad range of tasks from MoleculeNet.\n",
