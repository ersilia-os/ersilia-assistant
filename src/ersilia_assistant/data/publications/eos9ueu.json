    "tldr": "A novel method for searching large chemical databases using maximum common edge subgraph calculations enables rapid determination of nearest neighbors.",
    "summary": "The publication presents a new method for assessing 2D chemical similarity by calculating the maximum common edge subgraph (MCES) between a query molecule and molecules in a large database. Utilizing a pre-computed index, it allows for the identification of the 50 nearest neighbors within seconds, even in databases containing millions of compounds. This approach builds on previous methods developed in the 1980s and 1990s, leveraging modern high-performance computing and storage technologies. The innovative use of pre-computed indices significantly enhances the speed and efficiency of chemical similarity searches compared to traditional methods that have seen little change since the 1960s. This advancement holds potential for accelerating drug discovery processes by facilitating rapid chemical database searches.",
