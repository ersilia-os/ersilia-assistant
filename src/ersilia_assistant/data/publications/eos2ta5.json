    "tldr": "CardioTox net is a deep learning framework predicting hERG channel blocking using model ensembles to enhance prediction accuracy across metrics.",
    "summary": "CardioTox net is a deep learning framework designed to predict the blocking activity of hERG channels by small molecules, which is crucial due to the potential cardiotoxicity risk it poses in drug development. The framework employs a step-wise training approach with five individual base models, each using distinct chemical representations, and an additional neural network to integrate their outputs. This method effectively aggregates chemical information for improved hERG activity prediction across a range of metrics. The model was validated using three external test sets, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods like DeepHIT, particularly in metrics such as the Matthew correlation coefficient, accuracy, positive predictive value, and specificity. CardioTox net is proposed as a robust tool for screening small molecules for hERG channel blockade in drug discovery pipelines.",
    "relevance_to_biomedical_research": "The publication is highly relevant to biomedical research and drug discovery, particularly in predicting cardiotoxicity due to hERG channel blockade. This critical aspect of drug development helps prioritize safe molecules, reducing late-stage failures and ensuring safer therapeutic options.",
    "computational_methods": "CardioTox net utilizes a deep learning framework that combines multiple base models with different chemical representations. It involves a step-wise training process using featurization techniques like molecular descriptors, graph features, and fingerprints. Each model outputs a probability of a molecule being a hERG blocker, integrated by a meta ensemble neural network. Evaluated on three external test sets, it showed improved performance across multiple metrics, indicating robust predictive capabilities. The model's outputs are probabilities that can be interpreted for classification decisions.",
