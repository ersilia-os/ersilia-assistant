    "tldr": "DrugTax is a Python package for small molecule characterization and taxonomy identification, aiding AI and ML with tools for data visualization and chemical space analysis.",
    "summary": "DrugTax is a Python package designed to facilitate the classification and feature extraction of small molecules for use in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. It extends existing chemical taxonomy frameworks, making them accessible and simple to use. The package leverages SMILES representations of small molecules to concurrently extract taxonomy information and key features for big data processing. DrugTax provides functionalities for bulk analysis and visualization, enabling chemical space representation and assessment of molecular similarity. It addresses the limitations of existing protocols, such as Classyfire, by offering overlapping superclass classifications and user-installable code. DrugTax is integrated easily into drug discovery pipelines and is available for installation via PyPI and GitHub.",
