    "tldr": "SMILES Pair Encoding (SPE) is a new algorithm for tokenizing chemical data that improves performance in molecular generation and QSAR prediction tasks.",
    "summary": "SMILES Pair Encoding (SPE) is a novel data-driven tokenization algorithm designed to enhance the performance of deep learning models in cheminformatics. Inspired by the byte pair encoding, SPE learns a vocabulary of high-frequency SMILES substrings from large chemical datasets like ChEMBL. This method augments traditional atom-level tokenization by incorporating chemically meaningful SMILES substrings as unique tokens, resulting in shorter input sequences for deep learning models. SPE was evaluated on molecular generation and QSAR prediction tasks, demonstrating superior performance in novelty, diversity, and training set resemblance compared to atom-level tokenization. Additionally, SPE-based QSAR models were tested on 24 benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming traditional tokenization methods. An open-source Python package, SmilesPE, was developed to facilitate the implementation of SPE.",
    "relevance_to_biomedical_research": "The development of SMILES Pair Encoding is particularly relevant to drug discovery as it improves the efficiency and accuracy of computational models used in molecular generation and predictive tasks. By providing a more meaningful representation of chemical structures, SPE can enhance QSAR models, crucial for predicting the biological activity of compounds.",
    "computational_methods": "The SMILES Pair Encoding (SPE) algorithm is a data-driven tokenization method based on byte pair encoding, used for deep learning applications in cheminformatics. SPE first tokenizes SMILES at the atom level, then iteratively merges high-frequency token pairs from a large dataset, creating a vocabulary of SMILES substrings. This results in chemically meaningful tokens that reduce input sequence lengths for deep learning models, improving computational efficiency. SPE was evaluated using RNN-based language models for molecular generation and QSAR prediction, demonstrating superior performance. The method was tested on 24 datasets, consistently outperforming atom-level and k-mer tokenization methods.",
