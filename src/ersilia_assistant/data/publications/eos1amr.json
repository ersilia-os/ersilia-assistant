    "tldr": "GROVER is a self-supervised graph transformer improving molecular representation learning with unlabelled data, achieving significant performance gains in property prediction.",
    "summary": "The publication presents GROVER, a novel framework for molecular representation learning using a self-supervised graph transformer model. GROVER tackles the challenges of insufficient labeled data and poor generalization in molecular tasks by leveraging self-supervised tasks at node, edge, and graph levels. The model integrates message passing networks with transformer architectures to capture rich structural and semantic information from a large dataset of 10 million unlabelled molecules. The pre-trained GROVER model, with 100 million parameters, shows significant improvements in molecular property prediction tasks across 11 benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with an average improvement of over 6%. The framework underscores the potential of self-supervised learning to enhance the performance of graph neural networks in drug discovery.",
