    "tldr": "GROVER is a self-supervised graph transformer designed to learn molecular representations from large-scale unlabelled data, demonstrating superior performance in molecular property prediction.",
    "summary": "The paper introduces GROVER, a novel framework for molecular representation learning using self-supervised graph transformers. GROVER addresses the challenges of insufficient labeled data and poor generalization in molecular tasks by employing self-supervised learning across node, edge, and graph levels. It integrates Message Passing Networks into a Transformer-style architecture to learn rich structural and semantic information from unlabelled molecular data. The model is pre-trained on 10 million molecules with 100 million parameters, making it the largest GNN applied in this domain. GROVER significantly improves molecular property prediction performance on 11 benchmarks, showing more than a 6% improvement over state-of-the-art methods. The study demonstrates the potential of self-supervised learning and expressive pre-trained models in enhancing performance in molecular tasks.",
