    "tldr": "Public classifiers were developed using chemical and biological data to predict FDA drug-induced cardiotoxicity, enhancing drug development safety.",
    "summary": "The study addresses drug-induced cardiotoxicity (DICT), a significant concern in drug development. Utilizing the FDA-released DICTrank dataset, researchers explored chemical and biological data to predict cardiotoxicity. Key data included protein targets such as hERG, physicochemical properties, and peak plasma concentration, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities. Models incorporating these features showed substantial predictive accuracy, with an AUC-PR of 0.93. The study highlights the potential of omics data to enhance predictability and offer mechanistic insights, promoting safer drug development. Additionally, it provides the first public classifiers for DICT, offering a valuable resource for future research and application in drug safety assessment.",
    "relevance_to_biomedical_research": "Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a major cause of drug withdrawal during postmarket surveillance, impacting drug safety and patient health. This study provides classifiers for predicting cardiotoxicity using FDA data, contributing to the drug discovery pipeline by enabling early identification of cardiotoxic risks.",
    "computational_methods": "The study utilized machine learning models, particularly Random Forest classifiers, to predict cardiotoxicity using the DICTrank dataset. Input data comprised chemical structures, physicochemical properties, and biological data such as Cell Painting and gene expression features. Models were trained on over 1300 drugs categorized by cardiotoxic risk, achieving high predictive accuracy with an AUC-PR of 0.93. Outputs are interpreted as probabilities of cardiotoxic risk, aiding in safety profiling.",
