Traditional template-based methods are limited by coverage and scalability issues. This work proposes a template-free approach leveraging the Weisfeiler-Lehman Difference Network to efficiently explore product molecule space by identifying reaction centers, where graph edits occur. By constraining the reaction center, candidate products are enumerated and scored using a neural network that captures high-order molecular interactions. The approach demonstrates improved accuracy over traditional methods by 10% and operates 140 times faster. The method's accuracy rivals that of domain experts, with evaluations conducted on datasets from the USPTO. It represents a significant advancement in automating chemical reaction predictions, providing a scalable solution applicable to a broader range of reactions.",
