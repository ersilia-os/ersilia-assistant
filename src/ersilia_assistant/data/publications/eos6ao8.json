    "tldr": "The study applies integrated gradients explainable AI to graph neural networks for drug discovery, highlighting molecular features and improving model interpretability.",
    "summary": "This publication explores the use of integrated gradients, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, applied to graph neural networks (GNNs) for drug discovery tasks such as molecular property prediction. The study focuses on improving the interpretability of these models, which are often seen as black boxes. The authors trained models on datasets to predict plasma protein binding, hERG channel inhibition, passive permeability, and cytochrome P450 inhibition. The XAI approach successfully highlighted molecular features aligning with known pharmacophore motifs, identified property cliffs, and provided insights into non-specific ligand-target interactions. The methodology is open-sourced, allowing practitioners to train new models on additional clinically relevant endpoints. By enhancing model transparency, this work aims to facilitate rational molecular design and improve decision-making in drug discovery processes.",
