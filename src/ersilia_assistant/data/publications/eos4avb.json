Its application in identifying potential treatments for COVID-19 underscores its utility in addressing emerging infectious diseases.",
    "computational_methods": "ImageMol employs a self-supervised deep learning approach, leveraging a molecular image representation learning framework. The method involves pretraining a molecular encoder on approximately 10 million molecular images to capture structural information, followed by fine-tuning for specific tasks. The framework includes five pretext tasks to enhance feature extraction, ensuring consistency, relevance, and rationality of the molecular information. Input images are transformed into latent representations, and the output includes predictions of molecular properties and targets. The model achieves high accuracy across various datasets, with AUC values reported for classification tasks and low root-mean-square error for regression tasks.",
