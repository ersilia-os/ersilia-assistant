    "summary": "The publication introduces GROVER, a self-supervised framework for molecular representation learning using graph neural networks and transformer architectures. GROVER addresses challenges in AI-driven drug design, such as insufficient labeled data and poor generalization to new molecules, by leveraging a large-scale dataset of 10 million unlabeled molecules. The framework integrates message passing networks into a transformer-style architecture, enabling it to capture rich structural and semantic information of molecules through self-supervised tasks at node, edge, and graph levels. GROVER is pre-trained with 100 million parameters, making it the largest graph neural network model in molecular representation learning. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned for molecular property prediction, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on 11 benchmarks. The study highlights the potential of self-supervised learning in enhancing the performance of molecular property prediction tasks.",
