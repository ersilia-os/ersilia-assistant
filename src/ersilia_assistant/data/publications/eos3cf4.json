    "summary": "The publication investigates neural scaling behavior in large chemical models by varying model and dataset sizes over multiple orders of magnitude. The study employs models with over one billion parameters, pre-trained on datasets of up to ten million datapoints. By examining large language models for generative chemistry and graph neural networks for interatomic potentials, the authors introduce the Training Performance Estimation (TPE) framework to reduce the cost of scalable hyperparameter optimization significantly. This framework enables the researchers to discover empirical neural scaling relations and assess the interplay between physical priors and scale. The findings suggest that larger, pre-trained models present potential applications in prompt engineering and unsupervised representation learning. The study provides practical guidance for scaling studies in scientific deep learning and highlights new research directions at the intersection of massive scale and physics-informed deep learning.",
