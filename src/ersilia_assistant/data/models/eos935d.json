    "Title": "MetaTrans: human drug metabolites",
    "Description": "Small molecules are metabolized by the liver in what is known as phase I and phase II reactions. Those can lead to reduced drug efficacy and generation of toxic metabolites, causing serious side effects. This model predicts the human metabolites of small molecules using a molecular transformer pr-trained on general chemical reactions and fine tuned to human metabolism. It provides up to 10 metabolites for each input molecule.\n",
