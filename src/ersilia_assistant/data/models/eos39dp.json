    "Description": "Pharmacokinetics Profiler (PhaKinPro) predicts the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of drug candidates. It has been built using a manually curated database of 10.000 compounds with information for 12 PK endpoints. Each model provides a multi-classifier output for a single endpoint, along with a confidence estimate of the prediction and whether the query molecule is within the applicability domain of the model.",
