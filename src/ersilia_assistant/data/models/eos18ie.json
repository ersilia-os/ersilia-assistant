    "Title": "Substructure-based search of novel antibiotics",
    "Description": "The authors use a large dataset (>30k) to train an explainable graph-based model to identify potential antibiotics with low cytotoxicity. The model uses a substructure-based approach to explore the chemical space. Using this method, they were able to screen 283 compounds and identify a candidate active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.",
