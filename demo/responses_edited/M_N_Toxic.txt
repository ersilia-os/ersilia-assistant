**This is my understanding of your query:**

You have a collection of natural products that you are considering for antimalarial therapies.
You want to ensure that these natural products are safe for use in humans by assessing their potential for hERG toxicity.
You also want to evaluate their potential for interactions with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system.
You are looking for methods or strategies to screen and assess the safety of these natural products in relation to hERG toxicity and CYP metabolism.

I propose that you rank your candidates based on citotoxicty predictions for your selected endpoints.  The following models from the Ersilia Model Hub can aid you in this task:

**BayeshERG: hERG channel blockade** (eos4tcc):
This model is specifically designed to predict hERG channel blockers (IC50 < 10uM) and can help you identify potential cardiotoxicity risks associated with your natural products.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor).

**Ligand-based prediction of hERG blockade** (eos2ta5):
This model is based on public data of hERG inhibition (IC50<10uM).
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor).

**Coloring molecules for interaction with CYP3A4** (eos96ia):
MolGrad is a Message-Passing Graph Neural Network (MPGNN) with explainable features. MolGrad has been used on CYP3A4 inhibition ChEMBL data.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor).

**H3D virtual screening cascade** (eos7kpb):
The H3D centre has contributed its historic data on antimalarial and antituberculosis drug discovery pipelines and Ersilia has developed a suite of models with Zairachem, an automated AI/ML tool. Relevant to this use case, the model contains classifiers of inhibition against major CYP450 family members (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2D19)
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**NCATS CYP450 metabolism** (eos44zp):
The National Centre for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has measured the metabolic stability of compounds due to CYP450 enzyme interaction. NCATS has tested CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Those models are also available independently in the Ersilia Model Hub.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being (A) active (inhibitor) and (B) a substrate.

**ADMET properties prediction** (eos7d58):
ADMET-AI offers a suite of ADME-related predictors based on the Therapeutics Data Commons datasets. It can help you identify CYP interactions with your natural products.

**Summary**

To help in your problem, the Ersilia Model Hub offers several predictors for cardiotoxicity and ADME properties like CYP450 inhibitors. You can use a combination of them to select the non-toxic compounds. None of them has been specifically developed for Natural Products.
To run any of these models, simply use the Ersilia Model Hub command line interface, where the input.csv file contains a list of SMILES strings representing your collection.
