**This is my understanding of your query:**

You are at the starting point of a drug discovery campaign for COVID-19.
You have a virtual library of 1M compounds.
You want to filter the library to minimize the risk of hERG toxicity.
You also want to retain antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the filtered compounds.

I propose that you rank your candidates based on hERG cardiotoxicity predictions and assess the SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory potential for viral entry into cells or for viral replication of the non cardiotoxic compounds.  The following models from the Ersilia Model Hub can aid you in this task:

**BayeshERG: hERG channel blockade** (eos4tcc):
This model is specifically designed to predict hERG channel blockers (IC50 < 10uM) and can help you identify potential cardiotoxicity risks associated with your natural products.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor).

**Ligand-based prediction of hERG blockade** (eos2ta5):
This model is based on public data of hERG inhibition (IC50<10uM).
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor).

**REDIAL-2020 Sars-Cov-2 Antiviral Prediction** (eos8fth):
Redial-2020 has been trained on high-through put screening data from the NCATS COVID-19 portal. It returns the probability that compounds inhibit the viral entry and the viral replication.

**Sars-Cov Inhibition** (eos9f6t):
A ChemProp-based model trained using SARS-CoV-1 inhibition data. The model is a classifier that returns the probability of that a compound inhibts SARS-3CLpro-mediated peptide cleavage.

**Sars-Cov-2 Anti Viral Screening** (eos4cxk):
Using molecular graphs as images ImageMol provides a framework for drug activity prediction. In this model ImageMol is fine tuned on 13 assays concerned with a number of target categories ranging from viral entry to toxicity in humans. 
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**Summary**

Depending on the characteristics of the initial library you can start by discarding cardiotoxic compounds or by selecting the most active in SARS-CoV-2 inhibition assays. This can be complemented by assessing the binding of molecules to specific SARS-CoV-2 using docking. The Ersilia Model Hub does not have any docking capabilities at the moment.
To run any of these models, simply use the Ersilia Model Hub command line interface, where the input.csv file contains a list of SMILES strings representing your collection.
