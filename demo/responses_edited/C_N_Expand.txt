**Recommended Models**

Model: **eos8fth**  
**URL:** [https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos8fth](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos8fth)  
**Title:** Sars-Cov-2 Antiviral Prediction: REDIAL-2020  

**Explanation:**  
The REDIAL-2020 model is designed to predict the activity of small molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Trained on a large dataset from high-throughput screening, it employs an ensemble learning approach with diverse descriptor types, making it ideal for identifying potential analogs or derivatives. By inputting the chemical structures of the natural products you curated, you can predict their activity against SARS-CoV-2 and explore related chemical spaces to discover promising leads.

Model: **eos4cxk**  
**URL:** [https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos4cxk](https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos4cxk)  
**Title:** Sars-Cov-2 Anti Viral Screening  

**Explanation:**  
The ImageMol model utilizes a self-supervised deep learning framework to capture structural information from molecular images. This capability is particularly useful for analyzing the chemical properties of natural products. ImageMol's robustness in predicting molecular properties and targets, including those relevant to COVID-19, makes it a valuable tool for exploring the chemical space around your curated molecules and identifying potential leads.

**Instructions to Run the Models:**  

Prepare your dataset file (`input.csv`) containing a column labeled `smiles` with the SMILES strings of the molecules.

1. **For eos8fth:**  
   ```
   ersilia fetch eos8fth
   ersilia serve eos8fth
   ersilia run -i input.csv -o output_eos8fth.csv
   ```

2. **For eos4cxk:**  
   ```
   ersilia fetch eos4cxk
   ersilia serve eos4cxk
   ersilia run -i input.csv -o output_eos4cxk.csv
   ```
