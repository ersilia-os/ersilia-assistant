**This is my understanding of your query:**

You have manually curated the literature to identify natural products that inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and/or SARS-CoV-2.
You would like to explore the chemical space around these identified natural products.
You are likely seeking to understand the structural features and potential modifications that could enhance or alter the activity of these compounds against SARS-CoV-1 and/or SARS-CoV-2.

Expanding the chemical space of natural products can help identify easily synthesisable compounds with similar bioactivity. 
The following models from the Ersilia Model Hub can help you:

**REINVENT4: Libinvent** (eos6ost):
LibInvent is one of the modalities of REINVENT that appends R groups to the input. The attachement points must be provided or they will be guessed by the model

**CREM Fragment-Based structure generation** (eos4q1a):
Chemically Reasonable Mutations (CREM) breaks the input molecule into fragments and iteratively combines them with pre-set fragments

**SAFE Scaffold morphing** (eos8bhe):
Sequential Attachement-based Fragment Embedding is a GPT-like model that designs new compounds by representing them as interconnected fragments as a language model.

**CHEESE similarity search with multiple similarity measures and against various databases** (eos9uqy):
CHEESE is an ultra-fast search method for similar compounds in large databases like ENAMINE REAL, and takes into account measures like 3D shape, relevamnt for retaining bioactivity of compounds against specific targets.

**REDIAL-2020 Sars-Cov-2 Antiviral Prediction** (eos8fth):
Redial-2020 has been trained on high-through put screening data from the NCATS COVID-19 portal. It returns the probability that compounds inhibit the viral entry and the viral replication.

**Sars-Cov Inhibition** (eos9f6t):
A ChemProp-based model trained using SARS-CoV-1 inhibition data. The model is a classifier that returns the probability of that a compound inhibts SARS-3CLpro-mediated peptide cleavage.

**Synthetic accessibility score** (eos9ei3):
The model estimates the synthetic accessibility of a given compound based on its molecular complexity and the presence of certain fragments (based on PubChem)
Low scores indicate higher synthetic accessibility.

**Natural product score** (eos8ioa):
An Ersilia implementation of the RdKIT Natural Product score. Higher values indicate higher natural product likeness.

**Summary**

You can cerainly expand the chemical space around known SARS-Cov1 and SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using similarity searches and generative models. 
The broader chemical space can then be annotated for several SARS-CoV-2 endpoints. 
For the Natural Product space, synthetic accessibility might be a key element.
To run any of these models, simply use the Ersilia Model Hub command line interface, where the input.csv file contains a list of SMILES strings representing your collection.

ersilia fetch <model_id>

ersilia serve <model_id>

ersilia run -i input.csv -o output.csv
