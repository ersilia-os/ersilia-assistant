**This is my understanding of your query:**

You have identified an initial hit compound with _in vitro_ activity against _Plasmodium falciparum_ (IC50 < 1uM).
However, this compound is toxic in human cells.
You have generated 100 derivatives of the initial hit compound.
You want to identify which of these derivatives retain the bioactivity against _Plasmodium falciparum_ without causing toxicity in human cells.

I propose that you rank your candidates based on several citotoxicity parameters as well as activity against _P.falciparum_.  The following models from the Ersilia Model Hub can aid you in this task:

**Antimalarial activity (ABS and Sexual stages)** (eos80ch): 
This model predicts both the activity of compounds against both Sexual and Asexual Blood Stages (ABS) of the _P.falciparum_ parasite. Understanding the effect of your compounds on different stages of the parasite might be relevant to define their potential applications.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor).

**MAIP: Antimalarial Activity Prediction** (eos4zfy):
MAIP (Malaria Inhibitor Predictor) uses a consensus machine learning model to predict compounds with potential blood-stage malaria inhibitory activity. It has been built using a large dataset (~7M compounds) from several private and public sources.
MAIP returns a score, the higher the score the higher the inhibitory potential. This model posts queries to an online server, if you have IP concerns Ersilia offers a local implementation of the MAIP model (eos2gth).

**Antimalarial activity from OSM** (eos7yti):
Ersilia has built this antimalarial predictor based on the Open Source Malaria series 4 data. The series 4 is a chemical series with a triazolopyrazine core that have been proposed to inhibit the PfATPase4. 
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor)

**Antimalarial activity from MMV** (eos4rta):
Ersilia has built this antimalarial predictor based on historic _in vitro_ data from Medicines for Malaria Venture for _P.falciparum_ strain NF54 measured both as percentage of inhibition (with luminescence and LDH) and IC50.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**H3D virtual screening cascade** (eos7kpb):
The H3D centre has contributed its historic data on antimalarial and antituberculosis drug discovery pipelines and Ersilia has developed a suite of models with Zairachem, an automated AI/ML tool. Relevant to this use case, the model contains both a classifier of _in vitro_ activity (IC50) against the strains NF54 (drug-sensitive) and K1 (drug-resistant) of _P.falciparum_.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**ADMET properties prediction** (eos7d58):
ADMET-AI offers a suite of ADMET-related predictors based on the Therapeutics Data Commons datasets. It can help you identify several toxicity related endpoints like Cytochrome inhibition or hERG cardiotoxicity. In addition you can look at other properties such as lipophilicity, molecular weight, and topological polar surface area, which can help identify potential issues with bioavailability and toxicity.

**Summary**
To help in your problem, the Ersilia Model Hub offers several predictors antimalarial activity. I propose to start with a general ADMET predictor to discard toxic candidates and then assess whether the selected molecules retain the bioactivity profile desired. 
To run any of these models, simply use the Ersilia Model Hub command line interface, where the input.csv file contains a list of SMILES strings representing your collection.
