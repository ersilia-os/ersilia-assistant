**This is my understanding of your query:**

You want to identify synthetic compounds.
These compounds should have high efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum.
You also want to prioritize compounds with good solubility.
Additionally, you want to prioritize compounds with good permeability.
The initial studies will be based on these prioritized compounds.

If you don't have a starting library, you can look at standard synthetic collections like ZINC, ENAMINE Real or ChEMBL. 
The following models in the Ersilia Model Hub can help you filter those libraries:

**Antimalarial activity (ABS and Sexual stages)** (eos80ch): 
This model predicts both the activity of compounds against both Sexual and Asexual Blood Stages (ABS) of the _P.falciparum_ parasite. Understanding the effect of your compounds on different stages of the parasite might be relevant to define their potential applications.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor).

**MAIP: Antimalarial Activity Prediction** (eos4zfy):
MAIP (Malaria Inhibitor Predictor) uses a consensus machine learning model to predict compounds with potential blood-stage malaria inhibitory activity. It has been built using a large dataset (~7M compounds) from several private and public sources.
MAIP returns a score, the higher the score the higher the inhibitory potential. This model posts queries to an online server, if you have IP concerns Ersilia offers a local implementation of the MAIP model (eos2gth).

**Antimalarial activity from OSM** (eos7yti):
Ersilia has built this antimalarial predictor based on the Open Source Malaria series 4 data. The series 4 is a chemical series with a triazolopyrazine core that have been proposed to inhibit the PfATPase4. 
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor)

**Antimalarial activity from MMV** (eos4rta):
Ersilia has built this antimalarial predictor based on historic _in vitro_ data from Medicines for Malaria Venture for _P.falciparum_ strain NF54 measured both as percentage of inhibition (with luminescence and LDH) and IC50.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**H3D virtual screening cascade** (eos7kpb):
The H3D centre has contributed its historic data on antimalarial and antituberculosis drug discovery pipelines and Ersilia has developed a suite of models with Zairachem, an automated AI/ML tool. Relevant to this use case, the model contains both a classifier of _in vitro_ activity (IC50) against the strains NF54 (drug-sensitive) and K1 (drug-resistant) of _P.falciparum_.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**Aqueous solubility prediction** (eos6oli):
A Molecule Attention Transformer (MAT) was used to train a model using the AqSolDB. The model is a regression and predicts the experimentally determined solubility in water (LogS)

**Aqueous Kinetic Solubility** (eos74bo):
The National Centre for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has measured the Kinetic aqueous solubility (μg/mL) of NCATS drug discovery programs (11780).
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound having poor solublibity (< 10 µg/ml)

**Natural product score** (eos8ioa):
An Ersilia implementation of the RDKIT Natural Product score. Higher values indicate higher natural product likeness.

**Summary**
Here, I propose to select a starting library (in-house or from public databases) and filter it using the proposed models for bioactivity and solubility. To ensure your molecules are not natural product-like you can use the NP score to discard data. A limiting factor in your proposed experiment is the time to run predictions for large datasets (>10000 molecules)
To run any of these models, simply use the Ersilia Model Hub command line interface, where the input.csv file contains a list of SMILES strings representing your collection.

ersilia fetch <model_id>

ersilia serve <model_id>

ersilia run -i input.csv -o output.csv
