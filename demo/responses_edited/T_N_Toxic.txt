**This is my understanding of your query:**

You have curated the scientific literature for African Natural Products with potential antituberculosis activity.
You want to obtain a full toxicity profile for these compounds.
You plan to use this toxicity profile to annotate the compounds before proceeding with further research.

Identifying the toxicity profile early on the drug discovery cascade is important to discard compounds. The following models in the Ersilia Model Hub can help you:

**ADMET properties prediction** (eos7d58):
ADMET-AI offers a suite of ADME-related predictors based on the Therapeutics Data Commons datasets. It can help you identify CYP interactions with your natural products and other toxicity endpoints like Drug-Induced Liver Injury.

**H3D virtual screening cascade** (eos7kpb):
The H3D centre has contributed its historic data on antimalarial and antituberculosis drug discovery pipelines and Ersilia has developed a suite of models with Zairachem, an automated AI/ML tool. This includes primary and secondary ADMET assays like CYP interaction.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**BayeshERG: hERG channel blockade** (eos4tcc):
This model is specifically designed to predict hERG channel blockers (IC50 < 10uM) and can help you identify potential cardiotoxicity risks associated with your natural products.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor).


**Summary**
Based on your requirements, I suggest assessing the cardiotoxicity of compounds, as well as a more broad profiling with a general model like ADMET-AI. Models specific to the TB cascade at the H3D Centre can be helpful.
To run any of these models, simply use the Ersilia Model Hub command line interface, where the input.csv file contains a list of SMILES strings representing your collection.
