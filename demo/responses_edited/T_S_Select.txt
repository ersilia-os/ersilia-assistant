**This is my understanding of your query:**

You want to prioritize synthetic compounds that target Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The strains you are interested in are drug-resistant.
You want to select these compounds for preclinical studies.
You are looking for an effective approach to prioritize these compounds.

Your query is amenable for AI/ML modelling. I suggest you filter your library of interest for _M.tb_ activity and additionally check for relevant physicochemical parameters like solubility or cell wall permeation. The following models from the Ersilia Model Hub can help you:

**Antituberculosis activity prediction** (eos9ivc):
An Ersilia developed model based on a dataset provided by the Seattle's Children Hospital measuring _in vitro_ activiy of small molecules against _M.tb_ (% of inhibition, IC50 and MIC90).
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**H3D virtual screening cascade** (eos7kpb):
The H3D centre has contributed its historic data on antimalarial and antituberculosis drug discovery pipelines and Ersilia has developed a suite of models with Zairachem, an automated AI/ML tool. Relevant to this use case, the model contains a classifier of _in vitro_ activity (MIC90) against _M.tb_ H37Rv.
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**MycPermCheck: Membrane permeability in Mycobacterium tuberculosis** (eos8d8a):
_M.tb_ has a thick cell wall and it is challenging for compounds to enter the bacteria. MycPermCheck allows you to predict the permeability across the bacterial cell wall based on physicochemical properties.

**Qcrb Inhibition (M. Tuberculosis)** (eos24jm):
The cytochrome bcc complex (QcrB) is a suggested target for _M.tb_. This model can help you find compounds that inhibit specifically this target.
The model will classify compounds in class 1: active, class 2: moerately active, class 3:inactive.

**NCATS Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) 7** (eos9tyg):
The National Centre for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) has experimentally determined the permeability of compounds in a surrogate PAMPA assay and used the dataset to train a classifier. The model uses a PH=7.4 (neutral).
The model is a classifier that returns the probability of a compound being active (inhibitor) for each assay.

**Summary**

I suggest using _M.tb_ bioactivity predictors as well as cell membrane permeability tests. The Hub does not have an Mtb model specifically for drug-resistant strains. You can look for specific targets of your molecules, for example Qcrb.
To run any of these models, simply use the Ersilia Model Hub command line interface, where the input.csv file contains a list of SMILES strings representing your collection.
