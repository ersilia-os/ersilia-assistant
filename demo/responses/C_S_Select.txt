This is my understanding of your query:

    You have a library of synthetic compounds.
    You are interested in identifying compounds suitable for developing antivirals.
    The target for these antivirals is the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
    Bioavailability is a key factor to consider when selecting compounds.
    You want to know which compounds in your library are the best suited for this purpose.

I could not find any models that are relevant to your query.
