This is my understanding of your query:

    You want to design new synthetic compounds that target SARS-CoV-2.
    You want to optimize the binding of these compounds to SARS-CoV-2 targets.
    You want to increase diversity in your chemical library.
    You are looking for computational techniques to achieve these goals.

For your query, I have selected the following model:

Model: eos8fth

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos8fth

Title: Sars-Cov-2 Antiviral Prediction: Redial-2020

Explanation:

Based on the context , you can use the following computational techniques to design new synthetic compounds that optimize binding to S ARS -Co V - 2 targets while increasing diversity in your chemical library :

1 . ** En semble learning **: Combine multiple machine learning models to predict the activity of small molecules against S ARS -Co V - 2 , as implemented in RED IAL - 202 0 . 2 . ** Ch emin form atics **: Use chemical fingerprints , phys ico chemical descriptors , and top ological pharmac oph ore descriptors to design new compounds that optimize binding to S ARS -Co V - 2 targets . 3 . ** High -through put screening **: Util ize large datasets from the NC ATS COVID - 19 portal to train and validate machine learning models , ensuring that your designed compounds are likely to be active against S ARS -Co V - 2 . 4 . ** D iversity -oriented synthesis **: Employ computational methods to generate novel compounds with diverse chemical structures , increasing the likelihood of discovering new , effective anti -S ARS -Co V - 2 agents . 5 . ** Virtual screening **: Use computational models to predict the binding affinity of new compounds to S ARS -Co V - 2 targets , allowing you to prioritize compounds for experimental testing .

These techniques can be integrated into a computational workflow to design and optimize new synthetic compounds that target S ARS -Co V - 2 while increasing diversity in your chemical library .

Use the following recipe to run the identified models on your data. The following instructions assume that your dataset is stored in a file called 'input.csv'.

This file should contain a column called smiles with the SMILES strings of the molecules in your dataset.

ersilia fetch eos8fth
ersilia serve eos8fth
ersilia run -i input.csv -o output_eos8fth.csv
