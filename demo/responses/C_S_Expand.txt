This is my understanding of your query:

    You want to design new synthetic compounds that target SARS-CoV-2.
    You want to optimize the binding of these compounds to SARS-CoV-2 targets.
    You want to increase diversity in your chemical library.
    You are looking for computational techniques to achieve these goals.

For your query, I have selected the following model:

Model: eos8fth

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos8fth

Title: Sars-Cov-2 Antiviral Prediction: Redial-2020

Explanation:

Based on the context, you can use the following computational techniques to design new synthetic compounds that optimize binding to SARS-CoV-2 targets while increasing diversity in your chemical library:

1. **Ensemble learning**: Combine multiple machine learning models to predict the activity of small molecules against SARS-CoV-2, as implemented in REDIAL-2020.
2. **Cheminformatics**: Use chemical fingerprints, physicochemical descriptors, and topological pharmacophore descriptors to design new compounds that optimize binding to SARS-CoV-2 targets.
3. **High-throughput screening**: Utilize large datasets from the NCATS COVID-19 portal to train and validate machine learning models, ensuring that your designed compounds are likely to be active against SARS-CoV-2.
4. **Diversity-oriented synthesis**: Employ computational methods to generate novel compounds with diverse chemical structures, increasing the likelihood of discovering new, effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.
5. **Virtual screening**: Use computational models to predict the binding affinity of new compounds to SARS-CoV-2 targets, allowing you to prioritize compounds for experimental testing.

These techniques can be integrated into a computational workflow to design and optimize new synthetic compounds that target SARS-CoV-2 while increasing diversity in your chemical library.

Use the following recipe to run the identified models on your data. The following instructions assume that your dataset is stored in a file called 'input.csv'.

This file should contain a column called smiles with the SMILES strings of the molecules in your dataset.

ersilia fetch eos8fth
ersilia serve eos8fth
ersilia run -i input.csv -o output_eos8fth.csv
