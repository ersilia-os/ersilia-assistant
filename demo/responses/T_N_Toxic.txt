This is my understanding of your query:

    You have curated the scientific literature for African Natural Products with potential antituberculosis activity.
    You want to obtain a full toxicity profile for these compounds.
    You plan to use this toxicity profile to annotate the compounds before proceeding with further research.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Model: eos9ivc

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos9ivc

Title: Antituberculosis Activity Prediction

Explanation:

Based on your context, I would recommend using a machine learning model such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for predicting toxicity profiles of the compounds.

This is because these models are well-suited for handling high-dimensional data and can effectively capture complex relationships between molecular structures and biological activities. They are also robust to overfitting and can handle missing values, which is common in compound databases. Additionally, they can provide feature importance scores, which can help identify the most relevant molecular features contributing to toxicity.

Model: eos7kpb

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos7kpb

Title: H3D Virtual Screening Cascade Light

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the ZairaChem model for predicting the toxicity profile of the African Natural Products. This is because ZairaChem is an AI/ML-driven pipeline that includes models for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties, such as solubility and cardiotoxicity, which are crucial for assessing the safety of potential antituberculosis compounds. The model's ability to operate on standard computers with minimal data science expertise makes it a suitable choice for your needs.

Use the following recipe to run the identified models on your data. The following instructions assume that your dataset is stored in a file called 'input.csv'.

This file should contain a column called smiles with the SMILES strings of the molecules in your dataset.

ersilia fetch eos9ivc
ersilia serve eos9ivc
ersilia run -i input.csv -o output_eos9ivc.csv

ersilia fetch eos7kpb
ersilia serve eos7kpb
ersilia run -i input.csv -o output_eos7kpb.csv
