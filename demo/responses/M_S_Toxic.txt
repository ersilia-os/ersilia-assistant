This is my understanding of your query:

    You have identified an initial hit compound with in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 < 1uM).
    However, this compound is toxic in human cells.
    You have generated 100 derivatives of the initial hit compound.
    You want to identify which of these derivatives retain the bioactivity against Plasmodium falciparum without causing toxicity in human cells.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Model: eos4rta

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos4rta

Title: Antimalarial Activity (Mmv)

Explanation:

Based on the context, a machine learning model such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machine (SVM) would be best suited to this task. These models are particularly effective in handling high-dimensional data and identifying complex relationships between variables.

In this case, the model would be trained on the 100 derivatives, with the IC50 values and percentage of inhibition as the response variables, and the molecular structure of each derivative as the predictor variables. The model would then identify the key structural features that are associated with bioactivity and lack of toxicity, allowing you to prioritize the most promising derivatives for further testing.

The model's ability to handle non-linear relationships and interactions between variables makes it well-suited to this task, where small changes in molecular structure can have significant effects on bioactivity and toxicity.

Model: eos7yti

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos7yti

Title: Antimalarial Activity From Osm

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using cheminformatics and machine learning (ML) methods to analyze the 100 derivatives and identify the most promising ones.

The publication mentions the use of cheminformatics for compound selection and analysis, leveraging public datasets like GSK's Tres Cantos Antimalarial data. This suggests that computational methods can be applied to identify potential hits.

A suitable approach would be to use ML models, such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks, to predict the bioactivity and toxicity of the derivatives based on their molecular structure. This can be done using publicly available datasets and tools, such as the ChEMBL database or the RDKit library.

By applying these methods, you can identify the most promising derivatives that retain bioactivity against Plasmodium falciparum while minimizing toxicity in human cells. This will help you to prioritize further experimental evaluation and optimization of the most promising candidates.

Model: eos80ch

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos80ch

Title: Antimalarial Activity (Abs And Sexual Stages)

Explanation:

Based on the context, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model developed in the study is best suited to predict the stage-specific antimalarial activity of the derivatives. The SVM model has been shown to be robust and effective in identifying chemical features associated with antimalarial activity, and it has been validated against novel datasets.

You can use the SVM model to predict the antimalarial activity of the 100 derivatives, and then filter out the compounds that are predicted to be toxic in human cells. This will help you identify the derivatives that retain bioactivity without causing toxicity.

The computational methods used in the study, such as molecular fingerprints and cluster-based undersampling, can also be applied to the derivatives to identify the most promising candidates.

Model: eos2re5

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos2re5

Title: Admetlab Models For Evaluation Of Drug Candidates

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the ADMETlab platform to evaluate the 100 derivatives. The platform's comprehensive database and computational methods, including random forests, support vector machines, and decision trees, can help predict the ADMET properties of each derivative.

Specifically, you can use the platform's "ADMET prediction" module to generate predictions for the 100 derivatives, focusing on endpoints such as toxicity, solubility, and permeability. This will help you identify which derivatives retain the bioactivity against Plasmodium falciparum while minimizing toxicity in human cells.

Additionally, you can use the platform's "drug-likeness analysis" module to evaluate the molecular properties of each derivative, such as lipophilicity, molecular weight, and topological polar surface area, which can help identify potential issues with bioavailability and toxicity.

By using ADMETlab, you can efficiently and systematically evaluate the 100 derivatives and identify the most promising candidates for further development.

Model: eos9ivc

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos9ivc

Title: Antituberculosis Activity Prediction

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using a machine learning model, specifically a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model, to analyze the 100 derivatives.

This model is best suited to the task because it can:

- Handle large datasets (100 derivatives)
- Identify patterns and relationships between molecular structure and bioactivity/toxicity
- Predict the bioactivity and toxicity of each derivative
- Provide insights into the structural features responsible for the desired properties

A QSAR model would be an excellent choice for this task, as it can quickly and accurately identify the most promising derivatives, saving time and resources in the experimental process.

Model: eos2gth

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos2gth

Title: Maip Distillation: Antimalarial Potential Prediction

Explanation:

Based on the context, the MAIP model is best suited to predict which of the 100 derivatives retain bioactivity against Plasmodium falciparum without causing toxicity in human cells. The model's consensus approach, trained on multiple datasets, including bioactivity measurements, is likely to provide a reliable prediction of the derivatives' activity and toxicity profiles.

You can input the SMILES strings of the 100 derivatives into the MAIP platform to obtain predictions of their bioactivity and toxicity. The model's performance, as demonstrated in the publication, is robust across various validation datasets, making it a reliable tool for this task.

Use the following recipe to run the identified models on your data. The following instructions assume that your dataset is stored in a file called 'input.csv'.

This file should contain a column called smiles with the SMILES strings of the molecules in your dataset.
