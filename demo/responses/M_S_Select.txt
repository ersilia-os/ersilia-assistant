This is my understanding of your query:

    You want to identify synthetic compounds.
    These compounds should have high efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum.
    You also want to prioritize compounds with good solubility.
    Additionally, you want to prioritize compounds with good permeability.
    The initial studies will be based on these prioritized compounds.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Model: eos7yti

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos7yti

Title: Antimalarial Activity From Osm

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend the model used in the publication " Open Source Drug Discovery : Highly Pot ent Ant imal arial Comp ounds Derived from the T res Cant os Ary l py r roles " ( 201 6 ). This model is best suited for your task because it :

1 . Util izes open source collaboration for drug discovery , allowing for real -time data sharing and community involvement . 2 . Emp loys chem informatics for compound selection and analysis , leveraging public data sets like G SK 's T res Cant os Ant imal arial data . 3 . Focus es on identifying potent ant imal arial compounds , priorit izing those with good sol ub ility and perme ability for initial studies .

This model is particularly relevant for your task because it :

    Has already been used to identify highly potent ant imal arial compounds
    Prior it izes compounds with good sol ub ility and perme ability for initial studies
    Util izes open source collaboration , which can accelerate the identification of new therapeutic candidates

By using this model , you can leverage the existing data and expertise to identify synthetic compounds with high efficacy against Pl as mod ium f alc ipar um while priorit izing those with good sol ub ility and perme ability for initial studies .

Model: eos4rta

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos4rta

Title: Antimalarial Activity (Mmv)

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend using a Quant itative Structure - Activity Relationship ( QS AR ) model . This model is best suited for the task because it can :

1 . Predict the probability of inhib iting the malaria parasite ( strain NF 54 ) in IC 50 ( threshold 1 u M ) based on molecular structure . 2 . Evaluate the percentage of inhibition ( 50 %, measured by LD H and Lum ) for each compound . 3 . Provide insights into the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity , allowing for the identification of key structural features associated with high efficacy . 4 . Prior itize compounds with good sol ub ility and perme ability , as QS AR models can also incorporate phys ico chemical properties such as Lip inski 's rule of five .

This model is a good fit for the task because it can efficiently screen large libraries of compounds , identify potential hits , and provide a rational basis for further optimization .

Model: eos7kpb

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos7kpb

Title: H3D Virtual Screening Cascade Light

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend the Z aira Chem model for this task . The model is specifically designed for QS AR /Q SP R modelling and has a virtual screening cascade that includes 15 models for assays , including ADM ET properties like sol ub ility and perme ability . The model has achieved strong performance with AU ROC scores above 0 . 75 , making it suitable for predicting the efficacy of synthetic compounds against Pl as mod ium f alc ipar um while also considering their sol ub ility and perme ability .

Model: eos4zfy

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos4zfy

Title: Maip: Antimalarial Activity Prediction

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend using the MA IP web service for predicting blood -stage malaria inhibitors . This model is best suited for your task because it :

1 . Integr ates multiple QS AR models to boost prediction accuracy . 2 . Cons iders diverse molecular descriptors , including those related to sol ub ility and perme ability . 3 . Provides a consensus model that combines the strengths of individual models . 4 . Offers a publicly accessible web interface for easy compound prediction .

By using MA IP , you can identify synthetic compounds with high efficacy against Pl as mod ium f alc ipar um while also priorit izing those with good sol ub ility and perme ability for initial studies .

Use the following recipe to run the identified models on your data. The following instructions assume that your dataset is stored in a file called 'input.csv'.

This file should contain a column called smiles with the SMILES strings of the molecules in your dataset.
