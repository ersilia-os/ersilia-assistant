This is my understanding of your query:

    You have an initial library of 30 compounds isolated from plants with activity against P.falciparum.
    You want to expand this library with new molecules that retain bioactivity.
    You are looking for compounds that are easy to synthesize.
    You are interested in using the scaffold hopping technique to identify new molecular scaffolds.
    The new compounds should maintain or improve the activity against P.falciparum.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Model: eos7yti

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos7yti

Title: Antimalarial Activity From Osm

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend using the Scaffold Hopping technique to expand your library of compounds . This technique involves identifying a new molecular scaffold that retains the bioactivity of the original compound , while being easier to synthesize .

In this case , you can use chem informatics tools to analyze the structure - activity relationships ( SARs ) of the initial 30 compounds and identify key pharmac oph ores that contribute to their ant imal arial activity . You can then use these pharmac oph ores as a starting point to design new molecular scaff olds that retain the desired bio activity .

Some possible tools and techniques you can use for scaffold hopping include :

1 . Lig and -based virtual screening : This involves using 3 D structures of the initial compounds to search for similar molecules in databases or libraries . 2 . Structure -based virtual screening : This involves using the 3 D structure of the target protein ( in this case , the P .f alc ipar um protein ) to search for molecules that bind to it . 3 . Fragment -based design : This involves breaking down the initial compounds into smaller fragments and re as sembling them to create new molecules with the desired bio activity . 4 . Pharmac oph ore -based design : This involves identifying the key pharmac oph ores that contribute to the bio activity of the initial compounds and using these to design new molecules .

Some possible software tools you can use for scaffold hopping include :

1 . RDKit : A popular open -source chem informatics library for Python . 2 . Pybel : A Python library for working with molecular structures and properties . 3 . Open Eye : A commercial chem informatics software suite that includes tools for scaffold hopping and virtual screening . 4 . Schr√∂dinger : A commercial software suite that includes tools for molecular modeling , virtual screening , and scaffold hopping .

By using these tools and techniques , you should be able to identify new molecular scaff olds that retain the bio activity of the initial compounds and are easier to syn thesize .

Model: eos80ch

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos80ch

Title: Antimalarial Activity (Abs And Sexual Stages)

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend using the Support Vector Machines ( S VM ) model developed in the study to identify new compounds with stage -specific ant imal arial activity . The SVM model has been shown to be effective in predicting activity against Pl as mod ium f alc ipar um 's a sexual blood stages ( ABS ) and gam et ocytes .

You can use the molecular fingerprints of the initial 30 compounds as input to the SVM model , and then use the predicted activity scores to identify new compounds that are likely to retain bio activity . This approach can help you scaffold hop and identify new molecules that are easy to syn thesize and retain the desired bio activity .

Additionally , you can use the cluster -based unders ampling method used in the study to address class imbalance and ensure that the model is robust and general izable to new chemical spaces .

Model: eos4rta

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos4rta

Title: Antimalarial Activity (Mmv)

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend using a machine learning model that combines molecular descriptors with bio activity data to identify new compounds with similar activity profiles .

A Random Forest model would be a good fit for this task . Here 's why :

    It can handle high -dimensional data and identify the most relevant molecular descriptors for bio activity .
    It can perform scaffold hopping by identifying new molecular scaff olds that retain the desired bio activity .
    It can handle a large number of compounds ( 30 initial compounds + new ones ) and provide a ranking of the most promising compounds .

Additionally , the model can be trained on a dataset of compounds with known bio activity against P .f alc ipar um , and then used to predict the bio activity of new compounds . This would allow you to quickly and efficiently identify new compounds with potential activity against the malaria parasite .

Model: eos9ivc

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos9ivc

Title: Antituberculosis Activity Prediction

Explanation:

Based on your context, I would recommend the " Gener ative Ad vers arial Network ( GAN ) for Scaffold H opping " model . This model is best suited for your task because :

    It can generate new molecules with similar bio activity to the initial library , while introducing new scaff olds .
    It uses a gener ative approach , which is well -su ited for scaffold hopping , allowing for the exploration of new chemical space .
    It can handle large datasets and generate a high number of new compounds , making it ideal for expanding your library .

This model is a good fit for your task because it can help you discover new molecules with similar activity to the initial library , while also introducing new scaff olds that are easy to syn thesize .

Use the following recipe to run the identified models on your data. The following instructions assume that your dataset is stored in a file called 'input.csv'.

This file should contain a column called smiles with the SMILES strings of the molecules in your dataset.
