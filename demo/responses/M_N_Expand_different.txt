I prodded the model to pick up generative models, this is not ideal, but putting it out here for reference:

Prompt: I want to use generative models, such as those that do scaffold hopping because I have an initial library of 30 compounds isolated from plants with activity against P.falciparum and want to expand it with new molecules that are easy to synthesize and retain the bioactivity.

This is my understanding of your query:

    You have an initial library of 30 compounds isolated from plants with activity against P.falciparum.
    You want to use generative models, specifically scaffold hopping, to expand this library.
    The new molecules you want to generate should be easy to synthesize.
    The new molecules should retain the bioactivity against P.falciparum.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Title: Extending Molecular Scaffolds With Building Blocks

Explanation:

Based on your context, I would recommend using the MoLeR model, as it is specifically designed for scaffold extension and has shown excellent results in scaffold-based molecular generation tasks. Its ability to integrate atom-by-atom and motif-based generation, while maintaining chemical validity and optimizing scaffold retention, makes it an ideal choice for expanding your initial library of compounds.

Title: Pharmacophore-Guided Molecular Generation

Explanation:

Based on your context, I would recommend using a pharmacophore-guided deep learning approach, such as PGMG, to generate new molecules that retain the bioactivity of your initial library. This approach is best suited for your task because:

1. **Pharmacophore guidance**: PGMG uses pharmacophore features to guide the generation of new molecules, which is particularly useful when you have a small library of active compounds and want to expand it while retaining bioactivity.
2. **Scaffold hopping**: PGMG can generate molecules with diverse chemical structures while maintaining essential pharmacophore features, which is similar to scaffold hopping.
3. **Easy synthesis**: PGMG generates molecules that are easy to synthesize, which is a key consideration for expanding your library.
4. **Bioactivity retention**: PGMG's pharmacophore-guided approach ensures that the generated molecules retain the bioactivity of your initial library, which is critical for your application against P. falciparum.

Overall, PGMG's unique combination of pharmacophore guidance, scaffold hopping, and easy synthesis makes it an ideal choice for expanding your library of active compounds against P. falciparum.

Title: Variational Autoencoder For Small Molecule Generation

Explanation:

Based on your context, I would recommend using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for scaffold hopping. These models are well-suited for generating new molecules that are similar to the existing ones in your library, while also exploring new chemical space.

The use of GANs or VAEs for scaffold hopping is particularly appealing because they can:

1. **Retain bioactivity**: By learning from your initial library, these models can generate new molecules that are likely to retain the desired bioactivity against P. falciparum.
2. **Explore new chemical space**: GANs and VAEs can generate novel molecules that are different from the existing ones in your library, increasing the chances of discovering new, potent compounds.
3. **Easy synthesis**: These models can be trained to generate molecules with a focus on synthesizability, ensuring that the generated compounds are feasible to produce.
4. **Scalability**: GANs and VAEs can efficiently generate large numbers of new molecules, making it possible to explore a vast chemical space in a relatively short amount of time.

In your case, a VAE might be a better choice due to its ability to learn a continuous representation of molecules, which can be useful for exploring new chemical space while retaining the desired properties. However, a GAN could also be a good option, especially if you want to generate molecules with specific properties or characteristics.

Before choosing a model, I would recommend exploring the following:

1. **Data preparation**: Ensure that your initial library is properly formatted and preprocessed for use with GANs or VAEs.
2. **Model selection**: Choose a suitable architecture and hyperparameters for your model, considering factors such as the size of your library, the desired level of novelty, and the computational resources available.
3. **Evaluation metrics**: Define clear evaluation metrics to assess the quality and novelty of the generated molecules, such as their bioactivity, synthesizability, and diversity.

By following these steps, you can effectively use generative models to expand your library of compounds and discover new, potent molecules against P. falciparum.
