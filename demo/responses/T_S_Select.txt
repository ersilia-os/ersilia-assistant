This is my understanding of your query:

    You want to prioritize synthetic compounds that target Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
    The strains you are interested in are drug-resistant.
    You want to select these compounds for preclinical studies.
    You are looking for an effective approach to prioritize these compounds.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Model: eos9ivc

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos9ivc

Title: Antituberculosis Activity Prediction

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend using a machine learning model that incorporates a combination of computational methods , such as :

1 . ** M olecular docking **: to predict the binding affinity of synthetic compounds to specific targets in M . tuberculosis . 2 . ** Quant um mechanics **: to estimate the electronic properties of the compounds and their potential toxicity . 3 . ** M olecular dynamics **: to simulate the behavior of the compounds in a biological environment .

A suitable model for this task would be a ** Multi - Task Learning ( MT L ) model **, which can handle multiple objectives simultaneously , such as predicting binding affinity , toxicity , and stability . This would enable the priorit ization of synthetic compounds based on their potential effectiveness and safety .

The M TL model would be trained on a dataset of known compounds and their properties , and then used to predict the properties of new synthetic compounds . This would allow for the efficient identification of promising candidates for pre clinical studies .

Model: eos24jm

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos24jm

Title: Qcrb Inhibition (M. Tuberculosis)

Explanation:

Based on the context , I recommend using the Support Vector Machine ( S VM ) classifier with E CF P 6 fingerprints , as it emerged as the most effective model for predicting Q cr B inhibition . This model can help identify synthetic compounds that are likely to be potent inhibitors of Q cr B , a promising target for tuberculosis .

To prioritize synthetic compounds for pre clinical studies , follow these steps :

1 . Use the SVM classifier with E CF P 6 fingerprints to predict the Q cr B inhibition potential of synthetic compounds . 2 . Filter the compounds based on their predicted Q cr B inhibition scores , focusing on those with high scores . 3 . Validate the predicted results using external datasets and Y -random ization tests to ensure the model 's robust ness . 4 . Use the Q -T B web application to evaluate the potential Q cr B inhibitors and identify the most promising compounds for pre clinical studies .

By following these steps , you can effectively prioritize synthetic compounds targeting drug -resistant My cob acter ium tuberculosis strains for pre clinical studies .

Model: eos8d8a

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos8d8a

Title: Membrane Permeability In Mycobacterium Tuberculosis

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend using My c Perm Check , a tool for predicting my cob acterial perme ability . This tool can help you identify synthetic compounds that are likely to be perme able across the My cob acter ium tuberculosis cell wall , increasing their chances of being effective against drug -resistant strains . By using My c Perm Check , you can prioritize compounds with high predicted perme ability probabilities , thereby stream lining your pre clinical studies and increasing the likelihood of discovering effective treatments .

Model: eos46ev

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos46ev

Title: Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Inhibitor Prediction

Explanation:

Based on the context , I recommend using the X G Boost model , which demonstrated the best predictive performance in identifying My cob acter ium tuberculosis inhibitors . You can utilize the Chem TB web server , a freely available tool developed from this study , to predict potential inhibitors . This will help you prioritize synthetic compounds for pre clinical studies .

Model: eos4e40

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos4e40

Title: Broad Spectrum Antibiotic Activity

Explanation:

Based on the context , I recommend using the Chem prop model , a directed -message passing neural network , to predict antib acterial activity against My cob acter ium tuberculosis . This model has been shown to be effective in identifying novel antibiotics , including hal ic in , which is effective against carb ap en em -resistant Enter ob acter i aceae and My cob acter ium tuberculosis .

To prioritize synthetic compounds , you can :

1 . Use the Chem prop model to screen a large library of synthetic compounds , such as the Z INC 15 database . 2 . Filter the results to identify compounds with high predicted antib acterial activity against My cob acter ium tuberculosis . 3 . Emp ir ically validate the top -sc oring compounds using in vitro assays to confirm their efficacy . 4 . Select compounds with favorable pharmac okin etic and pharmac odynamic properties for further pre clinical studies .

By following this approach , you can effectively identify and prioritize synthetic compounds targeting drug -resistant My cob acter ium tuberculosis strains for pre clinical studies .

Model: eos7kpb

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos7kpb

Title: H3D Virtual Screening Cascade Light

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would recommend using the Z aira Chem AI / ML tool for virtual screening . This tool is specifically designed for drug discovery and can help identify potential compounds that target drug -resistant My cob acter ium tuberculosis strains . The tool 's QS AR /Q SP R modeling capabilities can predict the efficacy of compounds against these strains , allowing you to prioritize synthetic compounds for pre clinical studies . Additionally , the tool 's automated nature and minimal data science expertise required make it an efficient and scalable solution for this task .
