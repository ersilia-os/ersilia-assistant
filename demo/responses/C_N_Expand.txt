This is my understanding of your query:

    You have manually curated the literature to identify natural products that inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and/or SARS-CoV-2.
    You would like to explore the chemical space around these identified natural products.
    You are likely seeking to understand the structural features and potential modifications that could enhance or alter the activity of these compounds against SARS-CoV-1 and/or SARS-CoV-2.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Model: eos8fth

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos8fth

Title: Sars-Cov-2 Antiviral Prediction: Redial-2020

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the REDIAL-2020 model for exploring the chemical space around the natural products you've curated. This model is specifically designed to predict the activity of small molecules against SARS-CoV-2, and it has been trained on a large dataset of high-through put screening data.

The model's ensemble learning approach and use of diverse descriptor types make it well-suited for identifying potential analogs or derivatives of the natural products you've identified. By inputting the chemical structures of these natural products into the REDIAL-2020 web application, you can generate predictions of their activity against SARS-CoV-2 and explore the surrounding chemical space to identify potential leads for further investigation.

Model: eos4cxk

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos4cxk

Title: Sars-Cov-2 Anti Viral Screening

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the ImageMol model for exploring the chemical space around the natural products you've curated. This is because ImageMol is a self-sup ervised deep learning framework that excels in capturing structural information from molecular images, which is particularly useful for understanding the chemical properties and relationships of natural products.

ImageMol's ability to process large datasets and its robustness in predicting molecular properties make it an ideal tool for exploring the chemical space around your curated natural products. Additionally, its performance in predicting drug targets, including those relevant to COVID-19, suggests that it could be a valuable asset in identifying potential leads for further investigation.

Use the following recipe to run the identified models on your data. The following instructions assume that your dataset is stored in a file called 'input.csv'.

This file should contain a column called smiles with the SMILES strings of the molecules in your dataset.

ersilia fetch eos8fth
ersilia serve eos8fth
ersilia run -i input.csv -o output_eos8fth.csv

ersilia fetch eos4cxk
ersilia serve eos4cxk
ersilia run -i input.csv -o output_eos4cxk.csv
