This is my understanding of your query:

    You have a set of natural products with activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
    You want to explore related chemical structures to identify derivatives.
    The goal is to improve the solubility and ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) properties of these derivatives.
    You are looking for a strategy to identify potential lead compounds with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Model: eos9ivc

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos9ivc

Title: Antituberculosis Activity Prediction

Explanation:

Based on your context, I would recommend using the "Molecular Similarity" or "Structure-Based Virtual Screening" approach. This method involves comparing the chemical structure of your initial set of natural products to a large database of compounds to identify similar structures that may exhibit improved solubility and ADME properties.

A suitable model for this task would be a machine learning model trained on a dataset of molecular descriptors and properties, such as the RDKit model. This model can predict the solubility and ADME properties of new compounds based on their molecular structure, allowing you to identify potential derivatives that improve these properties.

Model: eos24jm

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos24jm

Title: Qcrb Inhibition (M. Tuberculosis)

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would suggest using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with ECFP6 fingerprints, as it was identified as the most effective model for predicting QcrB inhibition. You can use this model to explore related chemical structures and identify derivatives that improve solubility and ADME properties.

Here's a concise explanation:

1. Use the SVM classifier with ECFP6 fingerprints to predict the activity of your initial set of natural products against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
2. Explore the chemical space around the predicted active compounds to identify related structures that may improve solubility and ADME properties.
3. Utilize molecular editing tools or software to modify the chemical structure of the identified compounds to enhance their properties.
4. Validate the modified compounds using the SVM classifier to ensure they retain their activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

This approach can help you identify potential derivatives that improve solubility and ADME properties while maintaining their antitubercular activity.

Model: eos8d8a

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos8d8a

Title: Membrane Permeability In Mycobacterium Tuberculosis

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using MycPermCheck, a tool for predicting mycobacterial permeability. This tool can help you identify derivatives with improved solubility and ADME properties by predicting the permeability of your initial set of natural products and their related chemical structures. By analyzing the predicted permeability probabilities, you can select derivatives that are more likely to be effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis while also having improved solubility and ADME properties.

Model: eos7jlv

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos7jlv

Title: Gdbmedchem Similarity Search

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the GDB MedChem database, which is a medicinal chemistry-focused subset of 10 million molecules. This database was specifically designed to enhance synthetic accessibility and structural diversity for drug design. You can use the database to explore related chemical structures to identify derivatives that improve solubility and ADME properties.

The database's uniform sampling across molecular size, stereochemistry, and polarity, as well as its retention of higher sp3-carbon fractions and natural product likeness, make it an ideal resource for identifying potential derivatives of your initial set of natural products. You can use the database's 3D-visualization, similarity searching, and download capabilities to explore and identify potential derivatives that meet your desired properties.

Model: eos46ev

Title: Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Inhibitor Prediction

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the ChemTB web server, which was developed for predicting potential Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibitors. You can use this web server to explore related chemical structures and identify derivatives that improve solubility and ADME properties.

The ChemTB web server uses machine learning models, specifically XGBoost, to predict the activity of compounds against Mtb. You can upload your initial set of natural products to the web server and explore the predicted activity, solubility, and ADME properties of related chemical structures.

Additionally, you can use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, which was used in the study, to interpret the model outputs and identify important molecular descriptors that contribute to the predicted activity. This can help you to design and synthesize derivatives that improve solubility and ADME properties while maintaining or improving their activity against Mtb.

Model: eos9c7k

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos9c7k

Title: Similarity Search In Chembl, Drugbank And Unpd

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the GDB MedChem database. It is a curated database of 10 million small molecules optimized for medicinal chemistry, offering a diverse source for drug design. The database retains a high sp3-carbon fraction and natural product likeness compared to known drugs, making it an ideal resource for exploring related chemical structures.

You can use GDB MedChem to:

1. Perform similarity searching to identify molecules with similar structural features to your initial set of natural products.
2. Explore the database's 3D visualization capabilities to understand the molecular structure and properties of potential derivatives.
3. Download and analyze the molecular structures to identify potential modifications that could improve solubility and ADME properties.

GDB MedChem's focus on drug-like properties and structural diversity makes it an invaluable resource for identifying novel derivatives with improved properties.

Model: eos8451

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos8451

Title: Water Solubility

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the GROVER model to explore related chemical structures. GROVER is a self-supervised graph transformer specifically designed for molecular data, which makes it well-suited for tasks like molecular property prediction and structure exploration.

You can use GROVER to:

1. Pre-train the model on a large-scale dataset of molecular structures, including your initial set of natural products.
2. Fine-tune the model on a task such as predicting solubility and ADME properties.
3. Use the pre-trained model to generate new molecular structures that are similar to your initial set, but with improved solubility and ADME properties.

GROVER's ability to learn from large-scale unlabeled data and its self-supervised learning approach make it an ideal tool for this task.

Model: eos7d58

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos7d58

Title: Admet Properties Prediction

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the ADMET-AI platform to explore related chemical structures and identify derivatives that improve solubility and ADME properties. The platform's machine learning model, Chemprop-RDKit, can predict ADMET properties of small molecules, including solubility and ADME characteristics. By leveraging the platform's capabilities, you can:

1. Input your initial set of natural products and explore related chemical structures using the platform's graph neural network model.
2. Predict the ADMET properties of these related structures, including solubility and ADME characteristics.
3. Identify derivatives that show improved solubility and ADME properties, which can be further optimized for drug development.

ADMET-AI's unique features, such as contextual ADMET predictions using approved drugs from DrugBank, can provide valuable insights into drug-likeness and help you identify potential lead compounds.

Title: H3D Virtual Screening Cascade Light

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would recommend using the ZairaChem AI/ML tool for QSAR/QSPR modeling. This tool can help you explore related chemical structures and identify derivatives that improve solubility and ADME properties. Specifically, you can use the 15 models in the virtual screening cascade to predict the ADMET properties of your initial set of natural products and their derivatives. This will enable you to identify potential hits with improved solubility and ADME properties, streamlining the drug discovery process.
