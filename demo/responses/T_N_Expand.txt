This is my understanding of your query:

    You have a set of natural products with activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
    You want to explore related chemical structures to identify derivatives.
    The goal is to improve the solubility and ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) properties of these derivatives.
    You are looking for a strategy to identify potential lead compounds with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Model: eos9ivc

Title: Antituberculosis Activity Prediction

Explanation:

Based on your context , I would recommend using the " M olecular Similar ity " or " Structure -Based Virtual Screening " approach . This method involves comparing the chemical structure of your initial set of natural products to a large database of compounds to identify similar structures that may exhibit improved sol ub ility and AD ME properties .

A suitable model for this task would be a machine learning model trained on a dataset of molecular descriptors and properties , such as the RD Kit model . This model can predict the sol ub ility and AD ME properties of new compounds based on their molecular structure , allowing you to identify potential derivatives that improve these properties .

Title: Qcrb Inhibition (M. Tuberculosis)

Explanation:

Based on the context , I would suggest using the Support Vector Machine ( S VM ) classifier with E CF P 6 fingerprints , as it was identified as the most effective model for predicting Q cr B inhibition . You can use this model to explore related chemical structures and identify derivatives that improve sol ub ility and AD ME properties .

Here 's a concise explanation :

    Use the SVM classifier with E CF P 6 fingerprints to predict the activity of your initial set of natural products against My cob acter ium tuberculosis .
    Explore the chemical space around the predicted active compounds to identify related structures that may improve sol ub ility and AD ME properties .
    Util ize molecular editing tools or software to modify the chemical structure of the identified compounds to enhance their properties .
    Validate the modified compounds using the SVM classifier to ensure they retain their activity against My cob acter ium tuberculosis .

This approach can help you identify potential derivatives that improve sol ub ility and AD ME properties while maintaining their ant it ub erc ular activity .
