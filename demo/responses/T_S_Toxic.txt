This is my understanding of your query:

    You want to use the ChemDiv Diversity Set as a starting library for your drug discovery project.
    You are looking for molecules in this library that are least likely to interfere with CYP3A4 metabolism.
    You want these molecules to show selective activity against tuberculosis bacteria.
    You are seeking to minimize the potential for drug-drug interactions and maximize the efficacy of your compounds against the target disease.

I could not find any models that are relevant to your query.
