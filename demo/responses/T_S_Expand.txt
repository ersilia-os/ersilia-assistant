This is my understanding of your query:

    You are looking to use computational methods to propose new derivatives of existing synthetic hits.
    The goal is to enhance the activity of these compounds against tuberculosis.
    You also want to ensure that the new derivatives maintain good pharmacokinetic properties.
    You are seeking a computational approach to achieve this.

For your query, I have selected the following models:

Model: eos9ivc

URL: https://github.com/ersilia-os/eos9ivc

Title: Antituberculosis Activity Prediction

Explanation:

Based on the context, I would suggest using the "Computational Methods" section to guide your approach. Specifically, you can utilize:

    **Molecular docking**: to predict the binding affinity of new derivatives to the target protein, such as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme.
    **Quantum mechanics**: to optimize the molecular structure of the derivatives and predict their pharmacokinetic properties.
    **Machine learning**: to identify patterns in the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the synthetic hits and propose new derivatives with enhanced activity.

These computational methods can help you propose new derivatives that are likely to be effective against tuberculosis while maintaining good pharmacokinetics.

Title: Qcrb Inhibition (M. Tuberculosis)

Explanation:

Based on the context, you can use computational methods to propose new derivatives of synthetic hits that enhance activity against tuberculosis while maintaining good pharmacokinetics by:

1. **Retraining the SVM model**: Use the same molecular features and ECFP6 fingerprints to retrain the SVM model with the new synthetic hits.
2. **Molecular editing**: Utilize molecular editing tools, such as RDKit or Pybel, to modify the molecular structure of the synthetic hits while maintaining their core pharmacophore.
3. **Virtual screening**: Perform virtual screening of large compound libraries against the retrained SVM model to identify new derivatives with enhanced activity against tuberculosis.
4. **Pharmacokinetic prediction**: Use computational tools, such as ADME-Tox or pkCSM, to predict the pharmacokinetic properties of the new derivatives and identify those with good absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiles.
5. **In silico optimization**: Employ in silico optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithm or simulated annealing, to iteratively modify the molecular structure of the new derivatives to enhance their activity and pharmacokinetics.

By following these steps, you can computationally propose new derivatives of synthetic hits that enhance activity against tuberculosis while maintaining good pharmacokinetics.

Title: Membrane Permeability In Mycobacterium Tuberculosis

Explanation:

Based on the context, you can use MycPermCheck, a tool for predicting mycobacterial permeability, to propose new derivatives of synthetic hits that enhance activity against tuberculosis while maintaining good pharmacokinetics. Here's a concise step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify synthetic hits**: Use existing databases or literature to identify synthetic compounds that have shown activity against tuberculosis.
2. **Predict permeability**: Use MycPermCheck to predict the permeability of these synthetic hits across the mycobacterial cell wall.
3. **Analyze results**: Evaluate the predicted permeability probabilities to identify compounds with high permeability.
4. **Design new derivatives**: Use computational methods, such as molecular modeling and virtual screening, to design new derivatives of the identified synthetic hits.
5. **Predict pharmacokinetics**: Use computational tools, such as ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) prediction software, to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of the new derivatives.
6. **Optimize and refine**: Refine the new derivatives based on the predicted pharmacokinetics and permeability, and re-evaluate their activity against tuberculosis.

By following this approach, you can propose new derivatives of synthetic hits that enhance activity against tuberculosis while maintaining good pharmacokinetics, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective treatments for this disease.

Title: H3D Virtual Screening Cascade Light

Explanation:

Based on the context, you can use the ZairaChem AI/ML tool to propose new derivatives of synthetic hits that enhance activity against tuberculosis while maintaining good pharmacokinetics. Here's a concise step-by-step guide:

1. **Input your hit compound**: Provide the molecular structure of the synthetic hit compound to ZairaChem.
2. **Run QSAR/QSPR models**: ZairaChem will employ AI/ML techniques to predict the activity and pharmacokinetic properties of the hit compound.
3. **Analyze results**: Review the predicted activity and pharmacokinetic properties to identify potential areas for improvement.
4. **Propose modifications**: Use ZairaChem's AutoML algorithms to suggest modifications to the hit compound, such as changes to functional groups or molecular structure.
5. **Evaluate new compounds**: Run the modified compounds through ZairaChem's QSAR/QSPR models to predict their activity and pharmacokinetic properties.
6. **Select and prioritize**: Choose the most promising new compounds for synthesis and experimental validation.

By following these steps, you can leverage ZairaChem's computational methods to propose new derivatives of synthetic hits that enhance activity against tuberculosis while maintaining good pharmacokinetics.
